This project is set up around a header file functions.hpp and functions.cpp which needs to be linked when running all the c++ files. 
To get results from problem 5 and 6 no compiling, linking and running of the c++ files is needed. The python files does this themselves and generates plots from the data generated by the c++ programs

For problem 5 run:

python3 problem_5.py

for problem 6 run:

python3 problem_6.py

To reproduce rest of the results and compilation and linking of 5 and 6 by themselves:

Compile and linking with:

g++ problem_2.cpp functions.cpp -o problem2 -larmadillo

g++ problem_3.cpp functions.cpp -o problem3 -larmadillo

g++ problem_4.cpp functions.cpp -o problem4 -larmadillo

g++ problem_5.cpp functions.cpp -o problem5 -larmadillo

g++ problem_6.cpp functions.cpp -o problem6 -larmadillo


Run:

./problem2

./problem3

./problem4

./problem5

./problem6
